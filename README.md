### Key Refactoring Strategies

1. **Constructor Injection Optimization:**
   - Utilize `@RequiredArgsConstructor` for automatic constructor injection, simplifying the code and the dependency injection process.

2. **Improved Exception Handling:**
   - Implement `.orElseThrow()` in methods like `getStudentById` and `deleteStudentById` to provide clear feedback when records are not found.

3. **Update Method Logic Enhancement:**
   - Centralize the update logic within the service layer, using JPA's dirty checking to automatically apply changes, reducing unnecessary database interactions.

4. **Code Conciseness and Maintainability:**
   - Apply Lombok annotations such as `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@NoArgsConstructor` to reduce boilerplate code and enhance code maintainability.

### Project Structure Simplification
Merging service interfaces and implementation classes when possible to simplify the project structure and improve code manageability.

### Benefits of Refactoring
- **Enhanced Readability:** Makes the code easier to read and understand.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Simplifies future code modifications and extensions.
- **Development Efficiency:** Speeds up the development process by reducing the amount of manual code required.
- **Architectural Clarity:** Provides a clear separation of concerns, making the application more modular and easier to navigate.

### Conclusion
By applying the refactoring strategies outlined above, the Spring Boot CRUD Tutorial application becomes more aligned with modern Spring Boot practices, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient codebase.
